# hello-world

hello meatbots!

My name is Joe and I'm learning how to use github. I am mostly familiar with front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, JS) and some back-end (PHP, MySQL). I am interested in learning some more jQuery (mildly familiar), node.js (almost no familarity), and anything else that seems interesting to me.
